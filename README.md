Encryption:

The encrypt_data function reads the data from the provided file path.
It generates a random salt and derives a key using PBKDF2 with SHA-256.
An AES cipher in GCM mode is created and used to encrypt the data.
A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is generated for the data using the custom ZKProof class.
The salt, nonce, tag, proof, and ciphertext are combined into a JSON object and returned.

Decryption:

The decrypt_data function parses the encrypted JSON data.
It derives the key using PBKDF2 with the provided salt.
An AES cipher in GCM mode is created with the derived key and nonce.
The ciphertext is decrypted and verified using the provided tag.
The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is verified using the custom ZKProof class.
If the ZKP proof is valid, the decrypted data is written to the specified output file.
